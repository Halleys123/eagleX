# Experimental IoT controls to NodeMCU Clusters for Centralised Automation

## Overview
This project involves creating a centralized control system for desk automation and computer setup using NodeMCU, an open-source IoT platform. The system allows users to control various aspects of their desk and computer setup through a user-friendly web interface.

## Features
### Desk Automation:

Adjustable Desk Height: Control the height of your desk to customize your ergonomic workspace.
LED Lighting: Manage the brightness and color of LED lights integrated into the desk for ambient lighting.

### Computer Setup Controls:

Power Control: Turn your computer on or off remotely.
Monitor Adjustment: Adjust monitor settings such as brightness, contrast, and volume.

### Centralized Control Panel:

Access all controls through a centralized web-based control panel for ease of use.
Responsive Design: The control panel is designed to work seamlessly on various devices, including desktops, tablets, and smartphones.

### Security:

User Authentication: Secure access with user authentication to prevent unauthorized control.
HTTPS Support: All communications between the control panel and NodeMCU are encrypted using HTTPS for enhanced security.

## Troubleshooting
Ensure all hardware connections are secure.
Verify that NodeMCU is connected to the WiFi network.
Check for any error messages in the Arduino IDE Serial Monitor.
